        <h2 class="question">Why design?</h2>
        <p>Design has been in the background of my interests for a long time, I just didn’t always realize how.</p>

        <p>In high school, I designed golf courses on a computer program. Putting myself in the shoes of the players, I loved charting a challenging, yet fair and visually appealing path through each hole.</p>
        <img src="/Images/Golf%20Group.png">

        <p>That program lead me to initially becoming an Architecture major in college, before realizing designing didn’t want to design buildings. I then turned to my love of story and eventually graduated from Film School.</p>

        <p>I spent the next two decades helping develop other people’s stories, but I was always wanting to do more.</p>

        <p>During a UI/UX informational class which explained how the discipline involved research, making things look nice and functional, as well as simplify the experience for the user - I knew that was my path.</p>

        <p><span class="italics">UI/UX combined that creative itch I used to scratch with that golf game, with my abilities to develop narrative content.</span></p>

        <h2 class="question">The Importance Of Design</h2>
        <img src="/Images/designer.png">
        <h3 class="mini-subhead">Design tells a story</h3>
        <p>When you use a product, you are on a journey, be that to learn information, listen to a song or watch a movie, or see someone’s personal pictures they posted.</p>
        <img src="/Images/frustrated-face.png">
        <h3 class="mini-subhead">When design is bad, you get frustrated at the experience</h3>
        <p>Frustration means you and may give up the chase for what you’re looking to do, in favor of something that annoys you less than a broken journey.</p>

        <p>Good design gives you a connection as a user to the brand, and vice versa. If the journey is stimulating, it’s something you’ll come back to. If you pick the right colors, the right logos, it will entice people to come to your product for repeat engagement. </p>

        <img src="/Images/chaplin.png">
        <h3 class="mini-subhead">Think of design as characters in a great TV show</h3>
        <p>You accompany these people week in and out on a journey together, becuase you’re connected to them, and their goals as characters</p>
    </section>
    <section class="design-approach">
        <h2 class="question">How I Approach design, And what I’d change</h2>
        <p>I’m a consumer, and try to put myself in the shoes of users when I create something. I strive for prefer simple, logical and engaging design.
        </p>
        <img src="/Images/privacy.png">
        <p>Privacy is something I’m passionate about. so my kids have the opportunity to carve their own path, without having their entire life pre-mapped by any by product scrubbed from my data. </p>
